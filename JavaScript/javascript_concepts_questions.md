## What is difference between slice and splice in JavaScript?

The slice() method can be used to create a copy of an array or return a portion of an array. It is important to note that the slice() method does not alter the original array but instead creates a shallow copy. Unlike the slice() method, the splice() method will change the contents of the original array.
